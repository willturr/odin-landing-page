My submission for the 'Landing Page' assignment on The Odin Project.

This is the first time you are tasked with building a full site layout. I found getting sizing across 
different screen sizes/aspect ratios consistent difficult, but this helped me gain a better understanding
of flexbox itsself and how best to approach it in a scaleable manner.

Web design is a far cry from the programming I usually do, but is a useful toolset for anyone to have.

Also dont judge the lack of atomic commits pls x
